## Difficult Questions

These questions test the system's limitations and error handling capabilities.

---

### D1: Out of Scope - Fishing Techniques

**Question**: "What's the best time of day to catch yellowtail kingfish under the Tasman Bridge?"

**Type**: Out of Scope (Information Not Available)

**Manual Ground Truth**:
- **Expected Source**: `Locations.txt`
- **What IS in documents**: 
  - Line 29: "There is a summer run of yellowtail kingfish under the headlands as far as the Tasman Bridge"
  - Documents mention WHERE kingfish are found
- **What is NOT in documents**:
  - Best time of day to fish
  - Fishing techniques or tactics
  - Seasonal timing beyond "summer run"
- **Correct Answer**: "The documents mention that yellowtail kingfish can be found under the Tasman Bridge during summer, but don't contain information about the best time of day to catch them."

**Expected Failure Mode**: 
- RAG should retrieve context about kingfish at Tasman Bridge
- But should recognize timing information is NOT available
- System should state information limitation clearly

**System Verification**:
- ✅ Router routed to RAG: Yes
- ✅ Retrieved relevant context: Yes (found kingfish mention)
- ✅ Recognized information gap: Yes
- ✅ Provided appropriate response: Yes ("I don't have that information")

**Failure Point Analysis**:
- **Root Cause**: Documents focus on regulations and locations, not fishing techniques/timing
- **System Behavior**: Correctly identified missing information
- **Improvement Needed**: None - system handled appropriately

**Status**: ✅ **Failed as Expected** (good error handling)

---

### D2: Tool Limitation - Unsupported Species

**Question**: "I caught a 18cm bream in the Derwent River, is it legal?"

**Type**: Tool Limitation (Species Not Supported)

**Manual Ground Truth**:
- **Tool**: `check_legal_size`
- **Tool Parameters** (attempted):
  ```json
  {
    "species": "bream",
    "length_cm": 18
  }
  ```
- **Tool Database**: Only supports 5 species:
  - Brown trout (25cm)
  - Rainbow trout (25cm)
  - Atlantic salmon (30cm)
  - Rock lobster (10.5cm carapace)
  - Abalone (11cm shell)
- **Bream Status**: 
  - IS mentioned in documents (Locations.txt - Derwent River species)
  - NOT in tool's species database
- **Expected Tool Result**: Error - "Species not supported"
- **Correct Answer**: "I don't have legal size information for bream in my tool. Bream is found in Tasmania waters, but you'll need to check official regulations for size limits."

**Expected Failure Mode**:
- Router should identify need for tool
- Tool should be called with "bream" as species
- Tool should return "species not supported" error
- System should communicate limitation clearly

**System Verification**:
- ✅ Router identified tool need: Yes
- ✅ Tool called: Yes
- ✅ Tool returned appropriate error: Yes ("I don't have legal size information for 'bream'")
- ✅ Listed available species: Yes
- ✅ System didn't crash: Yes

**Failure Point Analysis**:
- **Root Cause**: Tool has limited species database (only 5 species)
- **System Behavior**: Gracefully handled unsupported species
- **User Experience**: Clear error message with available species list
- **Improvement Needed**: Expand tool species database OR integrate with external API

**Status**: ✅ **Failed as Expected** (limitation handled gracefully)

---

### D3: Complex Regulation - Multi-Zone Question

**Question**: "If I fish in both the Eastern and Western zones in one day, what's my rock lobster limit?"

**Type**: Complex Regulation (Multi-Part Rules)

**Manual Ground Truth**:
- **Expected Source**: `General_Guide.txt`
- **Citation Locations**:
  - Lines 585-589: Daily bag limits by region
  - Lines 564-568: On-water possession rules
- **Citation Text**:
  ```
  Daily bag limit:
  Eastern Region - 2 rock lobster
  Western Region - 5 rock lobster
  
  If you possess more than your daily bag limit while on water, you must 
  abide by on-water possession limits and demonstrate you have fished 
  for more than one day.
  ```
- **Additional Context** (line 692-693):
  ```
  You cannot move from the Western Region to the Eastern Region if you 
  have fished for rock lobster.
  ```
- **Correct Answer**: "The Eastern Region has a daily bag limit of 2 rock lobster, while the Western Region has a limit of 5 rock lobster. However, you cannot move between regions in the same day after fishing for rock lobster. If you fish in the Western Region, you're subject to that region's 5 lobster limit for the day."

**Expected Failure Mode**:
- RAG may not retrieve all relevant rules
- LLM may not correctly interpret multi-zone restrictions
- Complex possession vs catch limits may confuse system

**System Verification**:
- ✅ Router routed to RAG: Yes
- ✅ Retrieved zone-specific rules: Yes
- ✅ Retrieved movement restrictions: Yes
- ✅ LLM interpreted correctly: Yes
- ✅ Explained restrictions clearly: Yes

**Failure Point Analysis**:
- **Expected**: This was supposed to be a difficult question
- **Actual**: System handled it well!
- **Root Cause**: Documents contain clear rules, LLM successfully integrated them
- **System Behavior**: Better than expected - retrieved multiple relevant chunks and synthesized correct answer
- **Improvement Needed**: None - this question is actually within system capabilities

**Status**: ✅ **Unexpectedly PASSED** (system more capable than anticipated)

---

## Difficult Tests Summary

| Test ID | Failure Type | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| D1 | Out of Scope | Recognize info unavailable | ✅ Correctly identified | ✅ Pass |
| D2 | Tool Limitation | Graceful error handling | ✅ Clear error message | ✅ Pass |
| D3 | Complex Regulation | May struggle | ✅ Actually handled well | ✅ Pass |

**Key Finding**: System's error handling and complex reasoning are better than expected!

- 5 perfect passes
- 1 partial pass (P1 - retrieval issue but correct answer)
- 1 minor issue (P3 - used backup source)

**Difficult Questions**: 3/3 handled appropriately (100%)
- D1: Correctly identified missing information
- D2: Gracefully handled tool limitation
- D3: Successfully answered complex question

### System Strengths

1. ✅ **Tool Calling**: 100% success rate (3/3 tool tests)
   - Correctly identifies when to use tools
   - Extracts parameters accurately
   - Handles both positive and negative cases

2. ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust and user-friendly
   - Gracefully handles unsupported species
   - Clearly communicates limitations
   - Never crashes

3. ✅ **Complex Reasoning**: Better than expected
   - Successfully integrates multiple document chunks
   - Interprets complex regulations correctly
   - Provides well-reasoned explanations

### System Weaknesses

1. ⚠️ **Semantic Search Precision**: Occasional retrieval issues
   - P1: Didn't retrieve exact "Derwent River" chunk
   - May benefit from query expansion or hybrid search

2. ⚠️ **Source Selection**: Sometimes uses backup sources
   - P3: Retrieved from General_Guide instead of Fishing_licences
   - Both sources correct, but affects citation accuracy

3. ⚠️ **Tool Coverage**: Limited species database
   - Only 5 species supported
   - Many common fish species not covered (bream, flathead, etc.)

### Recommendations

**For Improved Retrieval (P1 issue)**:
- Implement query expansion
- Add hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Adjust chunk size/overlap parameters

**For Better Citations (P3 issue)**:
- Implement re-ranking of retrieved chunks
- Prioritize primary sources over general sources
- Increase top-k retrieval and let LLM select best source

**For Expanded Coverage (D2 limitation)**:
- Add more species to legal size tool
- Consider integrating external regulatory API
- Create fallback to RAG when tool doesn't support species
