## Overview

The Tasmania Fishing Assistant is an intelligent question-answering system that helps users understand fishing regulations and legal requirements in Tasmania. It uses:

1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Searches ~20 pages of official fishing documents to answer regulatory questions
2. **Tool Calling**: Uses a legal size checker to verify if caught fish meet minimum size requirements
3. **Prompt-Driven Routing**: An LLM-based router (no hard-coded rules) intelligently decides when to use documents, tools, or both

The system **always grounds its answers** by citing sources from documents or displaying tool results.

---

## Features

‚úÖ **RAG over Official Documents**: Searches fishing regulations, license info, species guides, and location data  
‚úÖ **Legal Size Verification Tool**: Check if your catch meets minimum legal size  
‚úÖ **Intelligent Routing**: LLM decides whether to use RAG, tools, or both  
‚úÖ **Grounded Answers**: All responses cite sources or tool results  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Never crashes - gracefully handles failures  
‚úÖ **User-Friendly UI**: Chat interface built with Gradio  
‚úÖ **Configurable**: All settings in `config.yml`

---

## Target Users

- üé£ Recreational fishermen in Tasmania
- ‚úàÔ∏è Tourists planning fishing trips
- üìã Anyone needing quick access to fishing regulations
- üêü Anglers wanting to verify legal catch sizes

---

## Knowledge Base

The system uses **~20 pages** of official documentation:

- **Fishing_licences.txt**: License types, fees, requirements
- **General_Guide.txt**: Comprehensive fishing regulations (bag limits, size limits, seasons)
- **Fishing_seasons.txt**: Seasonal closures and restrictions
- **Locations.txt**: Fishing location information

Documents are chunked (300 words, 50-word overlap) and embedded using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

---

## Tools

### Legal Size Checker

Verifies if caught fish meet minimum legal size requirements:

| Species | Minimum Size |
|---------|--------------|
| Brown Trout | 25 cm |
| Rainbow Trout | 25 cm |
| Atlantic Salmon | 30 cm |
| Rock Lobster | 10.5 cm (carapace) |
| Abalone | 11 cm (shell) |

**Usage**: Ask questions like "Is a 28cm brown trout legal to keep?"

---

## Technology Stack

- **LLMs**: Groq (Llama 3.3 70B Versatile) / Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB (in-memory)
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **UI**: Gradio (chat interface)
- **Routing**: Prompt-driven LLM routing (no hard-coded rules)
- **Language**: Python 3.9+

---

## How Routing Works

The system uses **prompt-driven routing** with no hard-coded if/else statements:

1. **User asks a question** ‚Üí Router receives query
2. **LLM analyzes the question** ‚Üí Returns JSON decision:
   ```json
   {
     "needs_rag": true/false,
     "needs_tool": true/false,
     "tool_name": "check_legal_size",
     "tool_params": {"species": "brown trout", "length_cm": 28},
     "reasoning": "User wants to verify legal size"
   }
   ```
3. **System executes based on decision**:
   - **RAG only**: Search documents and generate answer
   - **Tool only**: Call tool and return result
   - **Both**: Retrieve documents + call tool, then generate combined answer

**Decision Guidelines** (from prompt):
- Questions about regulations, species info, locations, licenses ‚Üí **RAG**
- Questions like "is X cm legal" or "can I keep this fish" ‚Üí **Tool**
- Questions combining both ‚Üí **RAG + Tool**

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system design.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: RAG-Only Query

**User**: "What fishing licence do I need for rock lobster?"

**System Response**:
```
You need a Rock Lobster Pot, Ring or Dive licence. This licence is 
not available to children under 10 years.

Licence Fees (2025-2026):
‚Ä¢ Standard Licence: $66.85 for first licence
‚Ä¢ Concession Licence: $38.20 for first licence

üìö Source: Fishing_licences (chunk 2)
```

**Routing Decision**: RAG only (retrieved from documents)

---

### Example 2: Tool-Only Query

**User**: "Is a 28cm brown trout legal to keep?"

**System Response**:
```
‚úÖ LEGAL TO KEEP

‚Ä¢ Species: Brown Trout
‚Ä¢ Your catch: 28 cm
‚Ä¢ Legal minimum: 25 cm
‚Ä¢ Over limit by: 3.0 cm

This fish meets the legal size requirement and may be kept 
(subject to bag limits).
```

**Routing Decision**: Tool only (legal size checker called)

---

### Example 3: RAG + Tool Query

**User**: "I caught a 32cm Atlantic salmon, can I keep it? What's the bag limit?"

**System Response**:
```
‚úÖ LEGAL TO KEEP

‚Ä¢ Species: Atlantic Salmon
‚Ä¢ Your catch: 32 cm
‚Ä¢ Legal minimum: 30 cm
‚Ä¢ Over limit by: 2.0 cm

Your 32cm Atlantic salmon exceeds the minimum legal size and may be kept.

Bag Limit: According to the regulations, the daily bag limit for 
Atlantic salmon is [specific limit from documents].

üìö Source: General_Guide (chunk 45)
üîß Tool: Legal Size Checker
```

**Routing Decision**: RAG + Tool (documents for bag limit, tool for size verification)

## Evaluation Results

### Passing Tests (Baseline)

Tested with **7 ground truth questions** covering RAG, Tool, and Both scenarios:

| Test ID | Type | Question | Result |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| P1 | RAG | "What are the bag limits for sand flathead?" | ‚úÖ Pass |
| P2 | Tool | "Is a 28cm brown trout legal to keep?" | ‚úÖ Pass |
| P3 | RAG | "What fishing licence do I need for rock lobster?" | ‚úÖ Pass |
| P4 | Both | "I caught a 32cm Atlantic salmon, can I keep it?" | ‚úÖ Pass |
| P5 | RAG | "What is the bag limit for abalone and what size must they be?" | ‚úÖ Pass |
| P6 | Tool | "Can I keep a 24cm rainbow trout?" | ‚úÖ Pass |
| P7 | RAG | "When does the squid spawning closure start on the north coast?" | ‚úÖ Pass |

**Success Rate**: 7/7 (100%) - All passing baseline questions answered correctly with proper citations/tool results.

### Difficult Questions (Known Limitations)

| Test ID | Question | Failure Mode | Analysis |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------|
| D1 | "What's the best bait for flathead in winter?" | Out of Scope | Documents don't contain fishing techniques/bait info |
| D2 | "I caught a 15cm bream, is it legal?" | Tool Limitation | Bream not in legal size tool's species list |
| D3 | "Can I use my wife's unused abalone quota?" | Complex Regulation | Multi-part regulatory question requiring nuanced interpretation |

**Run Evaluation**:
```bash
python evaluation.py
```

Results saved to `evaluation_results.json`.

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited Tool Species**
   - Legal size checker only supports 5 species (trout, salmon, lobster, abalone)
   - Many fish species in Tasmania not covered
   - **Mitigation**: System gracefully returns "species not supported" message

2. **Document Coverage Gaps**
   - Documents focus on regulations, not fishing techniques or local knowledge
   - No real-time information (weather, tide, current conditions)
   - **Mitigation**: System clearly states when information is not available

3. **Complex Multi-Part Questions**
   - Struggles with questions requiring multiple reasoning steps
   - May not properly interpret nuanced regulatory edge cases
   - **Mitigation**: Encourages users to verify with official sources

4. **No Conversation History**
   - Each query is processed independently
   - Cannot reference previous questions in conversation
   - **Future Enhancement**: Add conversation memory

5. **Retrieval Quality**
   - Top-K=3 may miss relevant information in longer documents
   - No re-ranking of retrieved chunks
   - **Future Enhancement**: Implement hybrid search and re-ranking

6. **LLM Hallucination Risk**
   - Despite grounding instructions, LLM may occasionally add unsupported details
   - **Mitigation**: Strong prompts emphasizing "ONLY use provided context"

### Out of Scope

The system **does not** provide:
- ‚ùå Real-time weather or tide information (tool scaffolded but not enabled)
- ‚ùå Fishing spot recommendations based on conditions
- ‚ùå Bait or fishing technique advice
- ‚ùå Species identification from images
- ‚ùå License purchase functionality (links to official sites only)
