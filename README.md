## Overview

The Tasmania Fishing Assistant is an intelligent question-answering system that helps users understand fishing regulations, plan fishing trips, and check weather conditions in Tasmania. It uses:

1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Searches ~20 pages of official fishing documents to answer regulatory questions
2. **Weather Tool Calling**: Provides multi-day weather forecasts with fishing condition assessments and trip planning recommendations
3. **Prompt-Driven Routing**: An LLM-based router (no hard-coded rules) intelligently decides when to use documents, tools, or both

The system **always grounds its answers** by citing sources from documents or displaying tool results.

---

## Features

‚úÖ **RAG over Official Documents**: Searches fishing regulations, license info, species guides, and location data  
‚úÖ **5-Day Weather Forecasts**: Get detailed weather forecasts with fishing quality scores  
‚úÖ **Fishing Trip Planning**: Find the best days to fish based on weather conditions  
‚úÖ **Intelligent Routing**: LLM decides whether to use RAG, tools, or both  
‚úÖ **Grounded Answers**: All responses cite sources or tool results  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Never crashes - gracefully handles failures  
‚úÖ **User-Friendly UI**: Chat interface built with Gradio  
‚úÖ **Configurable**: All settings in `config.yml`

---

## Target Users

- üé£ Recreational fishermen in Tasmania planning trips
- ‚úàÔ∏è Tourists scheduling fishing activities
- üìã Anyone needing quick access to fishing regulations
- üå§Ô∏è Anglers wanting weather-optimized fishing plans

---

## Knowledge Base

The system uses **~20 pages** of official documentation (`tas_fishing_guide.json`) includes following section:

- **Fishing_licences**: License types, fees, requirements
- **Species**: Comprehensive fishing regulations (bag limits, size limits, seasons)
- **Fishing_seasons**: Seasonal closures and restrictions
- **Hot_fishing_spots**: Fishing location information

Documents are chunked (300 words, 50-word overlap) and embedded using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

## Tools

### Weather Forecast & Trip Planning Tool

Provides **5-day weather forecasts** with fishing condition assessments for Tasmania locations. The system uses OpenWeatherMap API to deliver:

**Features**:
- **Multi-day forecasts** (1-5 days ahead)
- **Fishing quality scores** (0-10 scale) for each day
- **Best fishing day recommendations** based on conditions
- **Detailed weather metrics**: temperature, wind speed, rainfall, humidity
- **Trip planning suggestions** for optimal fishing times

**Fishing Score Calculation**:
The system scores each day based on:
- **Temperature** (ideal: 10-25¬∞C) - up to 4 points
- **Wind Speed** (ideal: < 15 km/h) - up to 3 points  
- **Rainfall** (ideal: < 2mm) - up to 3 points

**Score Ratings**:
- **8-10**: Excellent üé£‚ú®
- **6-7**: Good üé£
- **4-5**: Fair ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **0-3**: Poor ‚ùå

**Supported Locations**: All major Tasmania fishing locations (Hobart, Launceston, Strahan, Bicheno, St Helens, etc.)

**Usage Examples**:
- "What's the weather forecast for fishing in Hobart this week?"
- "When is the best day to fish in St Helens over the next 5 days?"
- "Should I plan a fishing trip to Strahan this weekend?"
- "What are the fishing conditions in Bicheno for the next 3 days?"

---

## Technology Stack

- **LLMs**: Groq (Llama 3.3 70B Versatile) / Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB (in-memory)
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **Weather API**: OpenWeatherMap API (free tier, 5-day forecast)
- **UI**: Gradio (chat interface)
- **Routing**: Prompt-driven LLM routing 
- **Language**: Python 3.9+

---

## How Routing Works

The system uses **prompt-driven routing** with no hard-coded if/else statements:

1. **User asks a question** ‚Üí Router receives query
2. **LLM analyzes the question** ‚Üí Returns JSON decision:
   ```json
   {
     "needs_rag": true/false,
     "needs_tool": true/false,
     "tool_name": "get_fishing_weather",
     "tool_params": {"location": "Hobart", "days": 5},
     "reasoning": "User wants weather forecast for trip planning"
   }
   ```
3. **System executes based on decision**:
   - **RAG only**: Search documents and generate answer
   - **Tool only**: Call weather tool and return forecast
   - **Both**: Retrieve documents + call tool, then generate combined answer

**Decision Guidelines** (from prompt):
- Questions about regulations, species info, locations, licenses ‚Üí **RAG**
- Questions about weather, forecasts, trip planning ‚Üí **Weather Tool**
- Questions combining both (e.g., "best location to fish this week") ‚Üí **RAG + Weather Tool**

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system design.

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Weather Forecast Scope**
   - Limited to 5-day forecasts (OpenWeatherMap free tier)
   - Daily summaries only (no hourly breakdowns)
   - No historical weather data
   - **Mitigation**: System clearly states forecast range and suggests checking official sources for extended forecasts

2. **No Tide Information**
   - Weather tool doesn't include tide times or heights
   - Important factor for coastal fishing not covered
   - **Future Enhancement**: Integrate tide prediction API

3. **Document Coverage Gaps**
   - Documents focus on regulations, not fishing techniques or local knowledge
   - No information about bait, tackle, or fishing methods
   - **Mitigation**: System clearly states when information is not available

4. **Location Coverage**
   - Weather API requires known location names
   - May not recognize very small towns or specific fishing spots
   - **Mitigation**: Returns error with suggestion to try nearby major towns

5. **No Conversation History**
   - Each query is processed independently
   - Cannot reference previous questions in conversation
   - **Future Enhancement**: Add conversation memory

6. **Retrieval Quality**
   - Top-K=3 may miss relevant information in longer documents
   - No re-ranking of retrieved chunks
   - **Future Enhancement**: Implement hybrid search and re-ranking

7. **LLM Hallucination Risk**
   - Despite grounding instructions, LLM may occasionally add unsupported details
   - **Mitigation**: Strong prompts emphasizing "ONLY use provided context"

### Out of Scope

The system **does not** provide:
- ‚ùå Hourly weather forecasts
- ‚ùå Tide times and predictions
- ‚ùå Moon phase information
- ‚ùå Bait or fishing technique advice
- ‚ùå Species identification from images
- ‚ùå License purchase functionality (links to official sites only)
- ‚ùå Real-time marine conditions (swell, sea temperature)

## Running Evaluation

To test the system with ground truth questions:

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

This will:
1. Run 8 passing baseline tests (RAG, Weather Tool, Combined)
2. Run 2 difficult tests (known failure cases)
3. Verify routing decisions, tool calls, and retrieved citations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified during evaluation:

1. **Tide Prediction Tool**: Integrate tide API for coastal fishing planning
2. **Extended Forecasts**: Support 7-14 day forecasts (requires paid API tier)
3. **Hourly Breakdowns**: Add hourly weather data for same-day planning
4. **Moon Phase Data**: Include moon phase for species that are moon-sensitive
5. **Marine Conditions**: Add swell height, sea temperature, water clarity
6. **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic + keyword search for better retrieval
7. **Re-ranking**: Re-rank retrieved chunks using cross-encoder
8. **Conversation Memory**: Support multi-turn conversations
9. **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate forecast accuracy
